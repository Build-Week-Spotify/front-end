## Proposal

[] What problem does your app solve?
    1. Finding more songs you might not otherwise find in the app. 
    2. Avoid unnecessary recommendations on your home-page in the app.

[] Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
    2. Implement a Neural Network to do a classification on song features.

[] What is the mission statement?
    1. Help users find and visualize songs that fit their personal taste.

## Features

[] What features are required for your minimum viable product?
    1. Build a model to recommend songs based on history or picked song.
    2. Create visuals to highlight differences between recommendations.
    3. User input form to get predictions.
    4. Page for user’s saved and favorite songs.
    5. User registration.

[] What features may you wish to put in a future release?
    1. See user’s favorite songs.
    2. Group songs into playlists and folders (by the user).
    3. Playlists by suggestor.
    4. Filter personal favorites by genre, artist, ect

[] What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?
    1. Pandora, Shazam, Spotify Radio Function. 
    2. They allow users to listen to music they know, but they limit discoverability, We want to allow more customization in song generation, and have    more sociability in user’s creations. IE Playlists.

    3. Flask
    4. React 
    5. Redux
    6. Heroku
    7. Docker
    8. Tensorflow
    9. axios

## Prototype Key Features

[] How long do you think it will take to implement these features?
    1. 2-3 days, 4th day for debugging
[] Do you anticipate working on stretch functionality after completion of a Minimal Viable Product?
    2. Most likely
